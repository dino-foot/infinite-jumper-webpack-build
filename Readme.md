- Eating the carrot should use an effect
- Eating the carrot should also use an audio
- The game should accept score/points per carrot and per stage, so for example I can tell the game, give 10 points for every reached stage and 20 points for each eaten carrot
- The more stages I reach, the faster/harder the game should be
